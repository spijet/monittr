Add your suggestions here!

* INPROGRESS Separate modules/classes properly into files
* TODO Rewrite tests for new version
** TODO Figure out how to test SSL
* TODO Tests for edge cases and weird setups (XML)
* TODO Pack a gem and post it to RubyGems
  Should probably change the name too, since the input data format is not
  backwards-compatible anymore.
* DONE Add HTTPS support
  CLOSED: [2018-07-23 Пн 19:30]
* DONE Add SSL-Client support
  CLOSED: [2018-07-23 Пн 19:30]
* Remove all web stuff?
  I feel like all web-related stuff (like Sinatra templates and whatnot) doesn't
  belong here. This library is supposed to fetch data from Monit API and give it
  back to the app that calls it.
* Remove Monittr::Cluster class
  Is it really needed?
